# EVM Documentation

This directory contains all technical resources for the **Emotion Vector Memory (EVM)** system.

EVM introduces a structured emotional layer for AI systems, enabling:
- long-term emotional identity,
- stable behavioural continuity,
- vectorized emotional transitions,
- internal emotional processing (DIA / subDIA),
- and interference-based reasoning.

## 📘 Available Documents

### **1. EVM_Technical_Spec_EN.md**
Full technical specification of the EVM architecture, including:

- Emotion Vectors (EV)
- DIA / subDIA processing flow
- PEV (user trajectory) updates
- EEV (entity baseline) updates
- FEV stabilization cycle
- Interference and deviation model
- Logging layers (ANSL, EVL, DIAL)
- Parameter ranges and behavioural rules

This is the primary reference for implementation.

## 📂 Additional Resources

System prompts are located in the **../prompts/** directory:

- **SystemPrompt_Average.md** — lightweight, simplified system prompt  
- **SystemPrompt_Full.md** — complete, full-density system prompt  

These files define how an AI agent should integrate and execute the EVM emotional-processing pipeline.

- **README.md** — project overview  
- **LICENSE.md** — license terms  
- **NOTICE.md** — legal notices

## 🧩 Purpose of this Folder

The **docs/** folder exists to organize all technical materials in one place, separate from:

- implementation prompts  
- code samples (future)  
- legal files  
- top-level project introduction  

This ensures the main README remains clean and accessible, while developers can still navigate the full specification easily.
